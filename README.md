MProjectNavigator
=====================

MProjectNavigator is a tool for viewing a Matlab project's source tree.

## Caution: Undocumented Features

This program makes extensive use of undocumented, unsupported Matlab features. Use at your own risk, do not use in production code, and use caution when using its source code as an example.

## Acknowledgments

I learned how to do the Matlab/Java tree programming from Yair Altman's <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14317-findjobj-find-java-handles-of-matlab-graphic-objects">findjobj</a> tool, and articles on his <a href="https://undocumentedmatlab.com/">Undocumented Matlab</a> site.
