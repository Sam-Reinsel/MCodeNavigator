Release Process
===============

To make a release:

* Update `VERSION` with the right version, removing "-SNAPSHOT"
* Update `doc/CHANGELOG.md` to finalize changes for this version
* `git commit`
* Make a git "vX.Y.Z" version tag (with `git tag -a`)
* Create a git "vX.Y-fixes" branch if this is a new major or minor version
* `make dist`
* Push the tags to create a Release on GitHub
* Upload the dist tarballs to the release on GitHub
* Update `VERSION` and `CHANGELOG` with new "vX.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT" to open development on the next version

To add later:
* Upload tarballs to the Matlab File Exchange page
* Update File Exchange page with release notes
