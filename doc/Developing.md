Developing MProjectNavigator
============================

If you want to hack on MProjectNavigator, generally all you need is a compatible version of Matlab.

If you want to hack on MProjectNavigator's custom Java components, you'll need:

* A Mac
* Matlab R2016b
* JetBrains IntelliJ

This is because the Java project is set up to reference Matlab R2016b as it's installed on macOS, to get access to its Java internals.

To build the MProjectNavigator distribution, you'll need `make`. That comes preinstalled on macOS.
