Summary:

A code-browser GUI tool for Matlab

Description:


MCodeNavigator is a GUI tool for viewing a Matlab project's source tree. This is for use within the Matlab desktop IDE.

_

When working in an IDE, I like having a tool that displays the entire source tree of the project I'm working on. Matlab's "Current Directory" window comes close, but not quite, because its file location isn't fixed, and I tend to bounce around a lot of directories when doing Matlab development. MCodeNavigator provides a view of your source tree that is fixed and independent of the current working directory. It also provides a view that lets you browse in terms of the Matlab package/namespace hierarchy, instead of the filesystem layout.

Usage
=====

All usage is done through a single function, `MCodeNavigator`. Call it with various options to display the navigator window, hide it, or configure it. See `help MCodeNavigator` for details.

There's also a keyboard shortcut! Press `Ctrl-Shift-P` to show or hide the navigator window.


Downloading Releases
====================

Instead of using the Download link on File Exchange (which will grab the latest development version from the master branch), I recommend you download the latest versioned release from the project's GitHub Releases page at https://github.com/apjanke/MCodeNavigator/releases. Those versions are less likely to be buggy.
